# CS420 Lab 3 - Hopfield Networks Documentation

## Description:
 - This program is designed to implement a basic Hopfield network using a series of 50 fully connected neurons that are represented by a 100x100 matrix of weights. 
 - This network is tested for stability over the span of 50 randomly generated imprents of length 100. 
 - Additionally, several graphs have been created to help visualize the data created in the program. Further discussion is in my writeup


 ## How to run:
  1. Open UpdatedHopfield.ipynb using Jupyter or the Jupyter extension on VSCode. 
  2. Make sure you have Python 3 installed alongside numpy and matplotlib 
  3. Run individual code cells in order by clicking the "Play" button at the top left. 
  4. Output of each cell will be displayed below each respective cell after being ran
  5. Success
